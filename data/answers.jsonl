This includes possession, cultivation, and consumption of up to one ounce of marijuana and up to six plants for personal use. However, it is important to note that public consumption remains illegal and driving under the influence of marijuana is strictly prohibited. It will take some time for the necessary regulations and licensing systems to be implemented, but California residents should expect legal sales and distribution of marijuana to begin by January 2018. After that, adults will be able to purchase marijuana from licensed dispensaries and use it for recreational purposes without fear of legal repercussions.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":0}

I will try to give a brief overview, and if not satisfied I can try to go deeper.<br><br>I would like to start by stating that neural nets are often mystified by the terms that were chosen for them. People with some exposure to statistics (like linear regression) could understand neural networks almost perfectly, but this is often mystified by the specific hyped terms.<br><br>Artificial Neural Network, simplified and at the core, is a method for solving ill-posed systems of equations or approximating an unknown function from observed values (same thing). In general you have (so called) targets and features. And your job then (or ANNs job) is to correctly guess the target, given some features. For example you might be presented with the data about the person, like weight, height, blood pressure, etc. (features) and your neural net should say the age of the person (target), given the data.<br><br>The neural net itself starts with a model. The model is a simple formula. In the simplest form it can be written as w1\\*blood_pressure + w2\\*weigth + w3\\*height = age. Where w1,w2 and w3 are your parameters (called weights). So you are assuming that age can be expressed as a sum of your features, weighted by some numbers.<br><br>Now having this frame in mind. You can do one thing - you can pick w1, w2 and w3 to be some numbers and then check how well they performed. So for each person that you have within your data you can check the error you made with your chosen values of w1, w2 and w3. The error in this case would simply be the difference between REAL age of a person and an age given by your rule w1\\*blood_pressure + w2\\*weigth + w3\\*height = age with the w1, w2 and w3 preselected. Then you can calculate some kind of total error for this system. A simple sum of all the differences between REAL and COMPUTED ages would be good enough for this.<br><br>And now your job is to find the best possible w1, w2 and w3, to predict the age, based on your features (weight, height, etc). This phase is nothing more than an optimization problem (finding the values w1,w2,w3 that give the least error on age). Within machine learning community this phase is often called \"learning\". So the neural net \"learns\" the parameters in some sense.<br><br>And after this phase - you are done. You have the first neural network trained to guess the age of a person, given the data about their weight, height and blood pressure. This was achieved by training the parameters w1, w2 and w3.<br><br>Now anyone familiar with ANNs will say right away that this is a network of exactly one neuron (not really a network). But it is enough to grasp the basic idea. And the more complex networks simply represent more complex functions of weights (not just multiply a weight times feature and add them up).<br><br>So when you have a trained network - you want to use it. The basic usage is to get a details about the person (height, weight, what else you got) and then add them to the equation. If your w1 was = 0.3, w2 = 0.2 and w3 = -0.3 and you got a person with weight = 80kg, height = 180cm and blood_pressure = 90: you simply calculate 0.3 \\* 80 + 0.2 \\* 180 - 0.3 \\* 90 = 33. And you guess that the person is 33 years old.<br><br>Of course ANNs are not magic, so they can't do the impossible. If it is not possible to estimate the age of a person given the data that you have - ANNs won't be able to do it.<br><br>So to finish and recap:<br><br>1. You have data with features and targets<br>2. You have a model for the data (which is directed by the architecture of ANN). The model is defined by the weights w1,w2,w3,w4...<br>3. You define an error between REAL targets and ESTIMATED targets<br>4. You find weights w1,w2... that minimize your defined error.<br>5. You use the network to calculate estimated values of unseen (new) data objects.<br><br>There is a lot of research done in the field and there are a lot of standard methods for all the steps above.<br><br>Hope this helped \/ was clear enough.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":0}

A synapse fires which creates a chemical connection to another synapse. When a specific set of synapses fire across these connections in a specific order, that sequence  is how your brain remembers the word 'banana'.<br><br>The more you repeat something, the stronger these connections become, so if I gave you a 10 digit number right now, you might remember it for few minutes, but because it's a new connection and the connection is newly formed and weak, it breaks down easily, so you forget it easily. This is why if you're trying to remember a phone number while looking for a pen to write it down, repeating it over and over to yourself makes it easy to remember...you're keeping the connections that represents that number active. When you learn something, those connections become permanent, making that memory much easier to recall.<br><br>So how does this relate to dreaming? Well, MRI images show that when you sleep, your synapses fire randomly...so the connections that are most likely to fire are the ones with the strongest most 'established' connections. It's basically electricity following the path of least resistance<br><br>So, if you've spent all day thinking about a particular thing, you're more likely to dream about it....so you're creating a feedback loop. You have these dreams, so you think about them a lot, which makes you more likely to dream about them, each time making those connections stronger and the dreams more likely (and possibly more vivid).<br><br>Now, that could all be 100% complete and total crap, but it's the theory that makes most sense to me.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":0}

The cane, also known as a \"hook,\" was wielded by offstage personnel ready to remove a performer who was bombing so the audience would not be subjected to an awkward performance. The act of \"getting the hook\" is still a part of popular culture and is used to remove anyone, whether a comedian or a politician, who is delivering a poor performance. The cane has since become a symbol of rejection and has been used in films and TV shows as an effective way to dismiss someone from the stage.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":0}

{"answer_id":"chatgpt-formal-144g86","question_id":"144g86","answer":"Switching from $1 bills to $1 coins will save money in the long run because coins last longer than paper currency. Coins can circulate for up to 30 years, whereas paper currency often needs to be replaced within just a few years due to wear and tear. Additionally, the cost of producing coins is lower than producing bills, which means that the government could save money by minting more coins than printing bills. Finally, coins are also more difficult to counterfeit compared to paper bills, which could potentially save the government additional money in the long run. Therefore, switching from $1 bills to $1 coins will help to reduce the cost of producing currency over time.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":0}

{"answer_id":"cq5seg7","question_id":"31wvxv","answer":"Tropical countries tend to be burdened by poorer agricultural resources and disease. Major crops such as rice, wheat and maize are much more productive in temperate climates. This is partly because tropical areas have poor soils depleted by heavy rainfall or no rainfall at all. Additionally, the frost in temperate climates help farmers control insect borne crop issues and actually helps the soils gather organic matter. This matter in tropics is quickly broken down by insects not held down by frost. Poor agriculture means poor nutrition, which is something temperate climates have used to combat a lot of diseases. Insect borne diseases such as malaria are knocked back each winter and have been a lot easier to combat. Finally, solutions which have worked in temperate climates to help farming and disease control are difficult to implement in tropical areas, as they are easy to spread within an ecological zone, but not across them.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":0}

A stock is simply worth what people *think* they are worth; nothing more, nothing less. The issue is that stocks are not just how much that share is worth *right at this moment*, but also *how much it will be worth in the future.* If, for example, I think GM is going to be worth ten times what it is today in five years time, and today the stock is \"worth\" $100, I'd be willing to pay $999 for it. But the guy across from me thinks GM is only going to be modestly successful, so he wouldn't pay a dime over $499.

For some, they were simply too closely associated with their Star Wars character, making it difficult for audiences to see them in other roles. Other actors may have struggled to find work due to the lack of diversity in Hollywood at the time. It was also a case of being in the right place at the right time, and unfortunately for some of the Star Wars actors, their big break came and went with the success of the film. However, many of the actors have continued to work in Hollywood, but their success may not have been as high-profile as their Star Wars days.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":0}
{"answer_id":"chatgpt-casual-3yf2s2","question_id":"3yf2s2","answer":"This is a common problem that many people face. When a train goes by, it can cause interference with the TV signal. This is because the train generates electromagnetic waves that can disturb the TV signal. The antenna can pick up these waves, which results in a loss of picture and sound quality. One way to fix this issue is by using a stronger antenna that can filter out the electromagnetic interference caused by the train. Alternatively, you can try repositioning your antenna to get a better signal. By doing so, you can enjoy uninterrupted TV viewing even when a train passes by.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":0}

Firstly, subwoofers are designed to handle a lot of power and regular plugs are usually not durable enough to handle this kind of power over long periods of time. Secondly, exposed wires and clips offer a more customizable and flexible installation option. Regular plugs can only be used with specific types of connectors and cords, whereas exposed wires and clips can be connected to a wider range of cables.

{"answer_id":"cps85yr","question_id":"30gflg","answer":"Here's a summary:<br>- It's the 19th century. Jews are being victimised in pretty much every country on the planet. A new political movement forms: Zionism, which is aimed at getting Jews their own nation-state where they can have a homeland and govern themselves. Naturally their preferred site for this nation-state is in the Palestine region of the Middle East, because Jerusalem is the most holy site in Judaism and also because the ancient Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea were located there.  <br>- The first wave of Jewish mass-immigration to Palestine (which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire) takes place around the 1880s, I think. Several more waves follow over the next few decades.  <br>- World War One happens, and the Entente intends to divide up the Ottoman Empire's territory amongst themselves. In 1917 Britain issues the Balfour Declaration, saying it will support establishment of a Jewish nation in Palestine at some point in the future. After WW1, Palestine falls under British control as the British Mandate of Palestine (which includes present-day Israel, Palestinian territories, and Jordan).  <br>- By the 1920s, more Jewish people are immigrating to the Mandate of Palestine from across the world. But there's a problem: at the time, the Arab population of Palestine consisted mainly of tenant farmers who didn't actually own the land they lived and worked on \u2014 so when the Jewish immigrants arrived and bought said land, the Arabs were forced to leave their homes. They ended up congregating in cities, and started saying \"Why should the Jews be the ones who get their own nation here? Where do they get off, stealing our homes and trying to supplant us? We're the ones who live here, it should be our nation!\" That's pretty much how Palestinian nationalism began.  <br>- So for the next 20-odd years there's plenty of fighting in the Mandate: Jews versus Arabs and Arabs versus Jews, both of whom are trying to found their own nation on the same patch of land, and both versus the British occupying forces. Yet more Jewish refugees arrive in the aftermath of World War 2. Around 1947, Britain is like \"Fuck this, we're done mediating, let's let the United Nations handle it.\"  <br>- In 1947 the UN proposes a deal that will divide the Israel-West-Bank-and-Gaza region into two nations: one Jewish, one Arab. The Arabs reject it as it looks like a pretty shitty deal, giving large swathes of Arab-majority land to the Jewish nation. (Although in retrospect, they probably should've taken it.) Fighting continues.  <br>- In 1948, the British withdraw. Israel declares independence, and takes control of the whole region. It's immediately attacked by all the surrounding Arab nations (which incidentally have no interest in Palestinian nationalism, and only want to grab the land for themselves); amazingly they actually manage to fight them off (although Jordan grabs the West Bank and Egypt grabs the Gaza Strip).<br><br>So that's how Israel came to be. They later regained control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War in 1967 (as well as the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula, the latter of which they later gave back to Egypt).","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":6.0,"pos":0}

{"answer_id":"d0zu5c6","question_id":"4aeqyx","answer":"I'm going to actually ELI5 here.<br><br>Fracking by itself is actually not bad as long as we do it in the right places. Frac fluid is usually a combination of water, lubricants and sand. The sand keeps the cracks we form open, the lubricants and other additives help deal with the mechanics of pumping fluid to high enough pressure to actually crack the rock. The water is there as a solvent (mix everything into it).<br><br>Fractures are unpredictable, typically they will travel along naturally weak parts of the rock. In many cases this is actually horizontally (flat for you 5 year olds) since most hydrocarbons we frack for (oil and gas) occur in sedimentary rocks like sandstone and more recently shale. These rocks are more or less deposited over time in big flat sheets, I'm not going to get into structures like anticlines, faults or domes except that sometimes a frack will travel along a natural fault line.<br><br>Now lets look at how a typical oil or gas well is constructed. There are typically at least 2 (if not 3 or 4) pipes put into the ground. The first one is called the surface casing. In most civilized parts of the world this is set in competent (stable) rock well below the lowest water bearing aquifer and cemented in place. Then we sometimes have 1 or more intermediate casings that run down to where we want to produce our oil or gas from. Since most wells are horizontal now this means this string of casing runs down right into the production unit and is also cemented in place by forcing cement down the well and up the sides of the casing. When done properly this provides two layers of protection to the water table. Then you run what is called the production liner. This is another string of pipe that has holes in it ONLY WHERE WE PLAN ON PUMPING OIL OR GAS. <br><br>So now that we have that background let's examine where it is OK to frack and where we should probably be worried. In deep deposits such as those found in the foothills of the Rockies in Canada (WCSB) fracking will NEVER contaminate the ground water UNLESS the drilling contractor did not properly set and cement those casings or the casing breaks for some reason. This is why I prefer to drill with at least one intermediate casing.<br><br>In shallow gas areas such as the Eastern US sometimes there is no room to set the surface casing deep enough to make it into a solid rock formation so they end up cementing casing in loose (highly permeable) rock that doesn't protect anything. Other times the fractures can actually travel far enough upwards to penetrate into the aquifer which is a whole new type of problem because we can't even pretend to know where the source of contamination is.<br><br>TL:DR<br><br>Fracking by itself is not bad. Most issues arise from improper construction of the well above the fractured zone.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":5.0,"pos":0}

In theory, you could get a gullible person to pay rent without a lease, and the moment the cash is in hand, the landlord calls the cops and gets them hauled out.  Without a paper trail saying that they were truly tenants and paid rent, there's nothing stopping this from happening.

So instead of dragging them out by the ankles, the cops leave it to the courts to decide who is actually in the right, and then act accordingly.<br><br>It's not a perfect system, and people certainly take advantage, but not as many as you would think.

Period.  ....Okay, that's not technically true, but they're the first to create enough organization, infrastructure and momentum *behind* their mobile devices to make a meaningful splash.

Maybe they're right. Here's the counterargument:<br><br>Trade: Asian countries want to sell stuff, Western countries want to sell stuff, we all want to buy stuff. Right now there are innumerable rules limiting what companies and people in different countries can and cannot buy from each other. Trade agreements try to get rid of some of these rules.<br><br>Why is this good? Because when you can sell to more people, you can make more money. There is also some orthodox (meaning accepted, not necessarily correct) economic theory that says that tariffs create a deadweight loss. <br><br>None of this is new, the WTO (previously GATT) has existed for ages with the purpose of reducing trade barriers. <br><br>Will this lead to more jobs going abroad? Maybe. More likely it will hurt low-skilled workers in countries that are better at high skilled things (I.e., if your country decides to specialize in high finance and Internet startups, its going to suck for your welders). <br><br>Investment: These are the rules that let companies \"sue\" governments for losses. Basically, this is fine for the U.S. but can suck for developing countries. These rules basically say to countries \"if we build a factory in your country, you can't just take it for no reason.\" Developing countries (and developed ones) actually do this from time to time, so the idea is that by promising not to just randomly take shit, countries will attract more foreign companies to invest (ideally creating jobs, paying taxes to the government etc).<br><br>For companies, it's good because they get to invest in booming countries like Indonesia without as much risk that an irresponsible government will nationalize their money and kick them out on a whim.<br><br>The problems with this are that 1 sometimes countries need to up and seize private property and 2 foreign investment isn't always as good as it looks in theory (generally developing countries covet foreign investment).<br><br>In any case, most of the investment protections probably are already contained in other treaties. The U.S. has loads of bilateral investment treaties (look up BITs UNCTAD I'm too lazy to link on mobile). So does China. Japan does not have the same sort of investment protection regime, but the again most people seem to consider Japanese politics relatively stable.<br><br>So there's your TPP. There's definitely some problems with it but the people who are losing their shit appear to be unaware of any of the developments in international economic law in the last 50 years. <br><br>Edit: I forgot IP.

{"answer_id":"chatgpt-formal-37yiqo","question_id":"37yiqo","answer":"Liquid is almost always stored in round containers on trucks because spherical shapes are best at evenly distributing weight. They\u2019re structurally strong so they can support the weight of the liquid without collapsing, like a rectangular container might under the pressure of its contents, while simultaneously spreading the load over the truck's axles. Spherical shapes also provide greater stability and control during transport by reducing the risk of sloshing or spilling as they take turns or go over bumps in the road. Additionally, round containers are easier to clean and sterilize, and reduce the amount of residue left in the container compared to other shapes. This makes them an efficient and practical choice for transporting liquids.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":0}

{"answer_id":"chatgpt-formal-3f5kr1","question_id":"3f5kr1","answer":"Rain has a specific scent because of a number of factors. One of the main reasons is because rain releases negative ions into the air. These negative ions interact with the positive ions in the air, such as pollutants and dust, neutralizing them and creating a clean, distinct scent. Additionally, rain also releases various organic compounds from the plants and soil, including oils and bacteria. When these compounds mix with the negative ions, they create the familiar, earthy scent associated with rain. This scent can be particularly strong after a dry spell, as it intensifies the release of these compounds when rain finally arrives. Overall, the combination of negative ions and organic compounds create the unique scent of rain.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":0}

Your best bet is to hit feet first, arms tucked in and appropriate holes clenched.<br><br>A big part of what kills you on water impact is deceleration trauma. How fast you decelerate in the water is directly connected to the overall length of what's entering the water; a long, narrow object penetrates deeper below the surface and decelerates at a lower speed, while a bunched up object comes to a dead halt much faster. Additionally, when you're all curled up in a ball, there's much less 'you' between your head and vital organs and the surface of the water; as gross as this likely sounds, but in a feet-down entry your feet, shins, knees and thighbones act as a crunchy \"crumple zone\" protecting your intestines and points north. It's probably a moot point if you're falling far enough to shatter bone on impact, but it could make the difference between the ER and the morgue. <br><br>Another big part of what kills you on water impact is disorientation.

However, since then, the focus has shifted to other space programs, and budgetary constraints have limited progress in developing newer technologies. Additionally, there are inherent risks associated with space travel, and the liability for manned missions has increased substantially since the early days of space exploration, leading to a greater emphasis on safety and reliability, which further adds to the difficulty and cost of such missions.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":1}

The only way for mass to escape a black hole would be through something called \"Hawking radiation,\" which is theoretical and not yet proven.

{"answer_id":"cecbftu","question_id":"1twc3a","answer":"Dear OP.<br><br>Mormons are considered crazy because they are different than the general run of the mill Christians. They are Christians, and define themselves as such. But they also believe in the following things:<br><br>*There is other scripture besides the Bible. The Book of Mormon. Mormons say that it was written by ancient prophets who lived in the Americas, and was translated by Joseph Smith by the power of God. Joseph is the founder of Mormonism. Mormons revere Joseph Smith as a modern prophet, but they dont worship him.<br>-There are modern prophets. In other words, Mormons believe that God is real, God knows what is going on here on Earth, and He cares enough to speak on the matter. The President of the Mormon Church is their Prophet. As far as I am aware (in my limited understanding at least) the only other Christian Church that makes a similar claim is the Catholic Church.<br><br>-Mormons have pretty strict (to some) dietary practices. A practicing Mormon (by practicing i mean one who actually believes and follows their teachings.) does not drink alcohol, does not do any drugs (prescriptions are fine), does not drink coffee. Some interpret this as they cant drink anything caffeine. But caffeine is never outlawed in their beliefs anywhere.<br><br>-Mormons have pretty strict laws regarding sexuality. Basically they believe its fine between a married man and his wife. But anything outside of that is a very serious no-no. Emphasis on a man and a woman marriage. Mormons define marriage as being between a man and a woman. Family is a pretty huge deal to them.<br><br>-Mormons have a number of cultural practices that set them apart from others. For example:<br><br>1. Many (though very far from all) young Mormon men, and some women, between the ages of 18-22ish go preaching their beliefs to people all over the world for 18-24 months. They dont get to choose where they go, the assignment is made by their prophets. Many people find these missionaries annoying. And many people think its strange for young people to go preach.<br><br>2. the so-called \"magic-underwear\". First off, if you ask any Mormon about it, they will probably be a little offended. It is roughly analagous to calling a muslim a towel head. Second, they dont actually believe (most of them, anyways) that there is anything magic about their underwear at all. It is a religiously proscribed garment that serves as a symbol for them of promises they have made. Its a symbol, like a flag, or a cross or a crucifix. Mormons just happen to wear theirs. Thats pretty much all it is. <br><br>3. someone else on this page said something about Mormon \"secret police\". There is no such thing. But they do like to keep track of each other. And each active member is assigned a few people or families for whom they are responsible to try and be friends with and help out if they can. But there is nobody in the Mormon church who is going to knock on your door in the middle of the night and take you for prison for speaking out against the Prophet or anything like that. You are free to do as you like, they cant stop you.<br><br>4. They are a tight knit group. Mormons tend to be a pretty tight community, and they can be pretty damn judgemental of anyone who does not adhere to their standards, kind of like some jewish communities. Honestly its hard to blame them. In their early history they were driven and forced out of their homes from one city and state to another. They eventually came out and settled Salt Lake City because they were forced out everywhere else. The state of Missouri had an extermination order against them at one point. That isn't to say its ok for them to be judgemental, its not, and some of them are very very bad that way, but they have some reason for it.<br><br>I could go on. But the basic idea is that people consider Mormons crazy because they are different from what they consider the norm. Mormons have pretty high standards that they are supposed to live up to. And when one of them does not people react stronger than if someone else did the same thing. Mormons have a lot of beliefs that set them apart from other Christians and which are more or less unique to them.<br>Having said that, they do tend to be very friendly people. I have gone on way too long though. And I am going to shut up now. I hope i gave someone a little better idea of an answer to this question.<br>*edited for formatting*","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":5.0,"pos":1}

That if something makes you sick, taking a small amount of it will cure you, and that the smaller amount of it that you take, the more potent it will be.<br><br>First of all, there's no basis in it. It's like me saying that you could cure a disease by finding the specific spectral frequency of the disease and filtering sunlight to resonate with that frequency.

With high levels of campaign spending necessary for political success, and with contribution limits for individual donors, large donors can wield significant influence over politicians who rely on them for funding. This creates an inherent power dynamic where donors may ask for policy or political favors in exchange for their financial support. Furthermore, the vast majority of political donations come from a small proportion of wealthy individuals and interest groups, which can amplify their influence. As such, politicians may feel beholden to their donors rather than to the general public they are elected to serve.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":1}

{"answer_id":"dshe7p2","question_id":"7phwq4","answer":"The US Constitution says that every 10 years, the government must do a census, essentially counting how many people live in the US, and plotting where those people live.  <br><br>Based on the results of the consensus, the government divvies out a certain number of congressional seats (it's been 435 seats for a long time) proportionally based on population.  <br><br>While the smallest states get just one member in the House of Representatives, most states have multiple representatives (peaking with California, which has 53 seats).  <br><br>Likewise, states use census data to determine where most people live.  <br><br>Based on that data, states are tasked with drawing lines for the districts in a process called \"redistricting\".<br><br>That abuse of redistricting is called \"gerrymandering\".  The name gerrymandering comes from when the governor of Massachusetts (Elbridge Gerry) and his party drew some odd looking districts in order to make sure that his party had a majority in most of them.  One of those districts looked like a bit like a skalamander, so it was mocked as a \"gerrymander\" district.  <br><br>The gerrymander districts work like this: <br><br>Let's say that there are 10 seats available to district in a state with 100 people.  If 60 of those people are part of the Cake Party and 40 are part of the Ice Cream Party, it would seem most fair if 6 out of 10 of the districts had Cake advantages, and 4 out of those districts had Ice Cream advantages (at least in theory).  <br><br>The Cake party has control of the state house and the governor's office, so they are in charge of drawing the lines.  Instead of making the districts represent the people, they draw all sorts of crazy lines to group people together so that every district has 6 Cakers and 4 Ice Creamers.  Instead of the districts representing the true will of the people, the crazy lines make it so that all 10 districts have Cake favor abilities... even if Ice Creamers and Cakers tend not to live in the same area. To get to that point, Cakers had to cut neighborhoods apart to split Ice Cream voters.  <br><br>Obviously, that kind of system isn't exactly fair.  While there are some conflicting and incomplete SCOTUS rulings about gerrymandering, it's generally accepted that courts have the right and authority to reject gerrymandering based on certain criteria.  <br><br>In the case of North Carolina, a panel of federal judges determined that North Carolina had drawn its lines based on \"invidious partisan intent\".  In other words, the court found that NC's lines weren't drawn to respect voters and existing political boundaries (like city\/county lines), but instead to pack voters for partisan reasons.  <br><br>Lawyers may be able to weigh in better, but the federal court's legal authority in that regard isn't necessarily written in bedrock. While the SCOTUS has previously upheld lower court rulings throwing out districts, they haven't created a test or standard for exactly what must be considered to determine if districts are fair.  It's still theoretically possible this ruling can be appealed, but I personally feel that's unlikely.  <br><br>To answer your \"why\" question, NC is forced to redraw their maps because the maps were made with political motivations instead of in good faith, and the courts called them out on it.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":3.0,"pos":1}

{"answer_id":"cgbz9aa","question_id":"21cz78","answer":"There are three main thin-screen display technologies: Liquid Crystal Displays, Plasma Displays, and Light Emitting Diode Displays.<br><br>In these are a couple of subcategories (I'll go through them one at a time): <br><br>LCDs<br>is the LCD lit from the side or from the back, and using a compact fluorescent lamp (CCFL) or an LED array (LED LCD, usually sold as LED).<br><br>Plasma<br>are the cells self colored, or do they use phosphors for color rendering?<br><br>LED<br>is the display's pixels made from silicon transistors, or organic light emitting diodes? (OLED)<br><br>If you're lost, stick with me for a minute, let's explain what those mean.<br><br>All displays use between 2 and 4 subpixels for each picture element (the normal is three: Red, Green, and Blue), which combine to form the color of one square on the screen.<br><br>Liquid crystal displays work on the principle of light called polarization.  Long story short, polarization can be used to create a light filter.  In front of each pixel is a small bit of liquid crystal that can either polarize the light or not.  When it polarizes the light, the light will be blocked by the next layer, which is a passive polarizer.  When it doesn't polarize the light, the light goes through.  And if it partially goes through, it filters out some of the brightness, running from black to white.  The liquid crystals respond to an electric charge to change the amount of polarization and create a shade of gray.  Color filters over each of the subpixels change the shade of gray into a shade of color.  Since the liquid crystal only filters the light, a light source is needed, either a CCFL or an LED panel behind or along the side of the display.  This is a major simplification, but that's the essence of what the liquid crystals do.<br><br>Plasma<br>Plasma is a state of matter, where a gas has so much energy it begins to glow.  By trapping small amounts of gas in glass cells and electrifying them for a specific amount of time, I can make the glow and control how bright they glow.  When they glow, they either emit colored light (red, green, or blue) to make up sub pixels, or they emit invisible light that is absorbed by a coating, called a phosphor, on the surface of the cell that then glows a specific color.<br><br>LED<br>LEDs are little electronics that emit light when a charge of sufficient voltage is passed over the diode, because of some very specific bits of physics.  The light the LEDs emit are very specific in color, and therefore are color tuned, with one LED for each sub pixel.  In large, stadium size displays, full-size LEDs can be used, while it's difficult to make minature LEDs for a flat panel display.  So, organic LEDs are used instead, which use chemical elements that can be painted onto surfaces to make the little LED.<br><br>Strengths and Weaknesses:<br>LCDs: Typically are the least expensive type of display to make and therefore buy, but suffer from high black points (greyish blacks) because of imperfect filtering, and poor color reproduction, especially from off-angle viewing (because of the way the filter works).  LED backlights help with the color reproduction problems, and other technologies such as TFT IPS LCD technology help increase the off-angle viewing, but cost more.  LCDs can operate at high frequencies, like 120 or 240Hz, and work well for 3D displays for that reason.<br><br>Plasma: These give true blacks and deep color reproduction, but have fixed frequencies of 50 or 60Hz, suck back a TON of electricity, have a scan pattern (which will make them flicker when filmed), and are very heavy.  They can be expensive to purchase.<br><br>LED: OLED is a new technology and only found on some phones, primarily, and larger LED displays are usually expensive to build; in the future, OLEDs should give consumers the best of both worlds - the low power and high speed of LCDs, with the true blacks and wide color gamut of Plasma.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":3.0,"pos":1}

The process involves drilling deep into the earth and injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure. The part of the process that makes it harmful to the environment is the injection of chemicals. These chemicals can contaminate water supplies, harm wildlife, and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Fracking can also cause the release of methane gas, which is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.

{"answer_id":"chatgpt-formal-3af32j","question_id":"3af32j","answer":"Squatting involves the act of occupying an unused, abandoned, or unoccupied property without the owner's consent. Squatters usually target properties that have been left unattended for some time or are in foreclosure. To take over a home, squatters typically enter the property when the owner is absent and change the locks. They then live in the property and may even make modifications without the knowledge of the owner. Squatters often rely on legal loopholes or local regulations that permit the continued occupancy of the property if they can prove that they have lived there for an extended period and that the owner has neglected it. Squatting is illegal in many jurisdictions, and owners can take legal action to evict squatters from their property.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":1}

{"answer_id":"djepgck","question_id":"6jili6","answer":"The UK does have constitutional laws -- what it doesn't have is a single document called \"the Constitution\".<br><br>Any organization's constitution is the set of rules which dictate how that organization is to be run and exactly what its ruling body can and can't do -- and a country's constitution is no different. It's just that, in the UK, these laws are found scattered about the place, and there are also various protocols, traditions and regulations that are all part of the constitution.<br><br>An important reason for that is that there has been no radical change of the system of government recently, and it's very old. The UK isn't like, say, the USA, which was relatively recently founded and on the principle that it should be very different from the way Old World countries were run; or Germany, which only became a nation state in 1871 and has had to start from scratch several times since then -- most recently following the Second World War (the current German constitution, called the \"Basic Law\", came into effect in 1949).<br><br>The British constitution has simply evolved over time, pretty much uninterrupted, from \"Do whatever the king tells you to do\" to the current model of \"Do whatever the king tells you to do, except that the king is only allowed to tell you to do things the democratically elected government has decided upon.\" One of the most famous (but not, contrary to what Americans are usually taught in schools, the most important) steps in that process was the Magna Carta of 1215, a treaty signed by the truly awful King John in which he agreed not to be quite so horrible to his barons. Since then, new treaties, laws and traditions have come into being and now have the force of constitutional law. At no point was there a meeting at which legal experts drew up a document called \"The Constitution\".<br><br>This does mean that the constitution can be changed with relative ease. In some countries, a change to the constitution will require something like a 2\/3 majority and\/or a referendum to pass, for example. In Britain, a simple Act of Parliament can change the constitution: for example, in 2010, a law was passed fixing the parliamentary term at five years -- previously, a government could call an election at any time within five years. (The latest election was called early, but the law says that's possible if it gets 2\/3 majority support, which it did.)<br><br>That is quite scary, but the most important parts of constitutional law are beset by all sorts of safeguards which can't be removed quite so easily, and Parliament must observe the rule of law. Recently, for example, the Supreme Court prevented the government from using what's called the \"Royal Prerogative\" to authorize Britain's withdrawal from the EU without Parliamentary approval -- the referendum had made no mention of using the Royal Prerogative, and so a bill had to be introduced, debated and voted on.<br><br>Some things are technically possible, but very much constitute a nuclear option. In the TV drama *King Charles III*, the king refuses to sign a bill into law, enters the House of Commons and dissolves Parliament. While he could, in theory, do all those things, in reality any one of them would provoke a constitutional crisis and probably end the monarchy (the last time a king walked into the Commons, it started a civil war).<br><br>And it also means that it's often not clear what the constitution says, or even if it says anything at all. At the moment, Britain has a minority government -- there are more MPs on the opposition benches than on the government benches. We've just had the Queen's Speech, in which the Queen reads out a list of things the government has on its to-do list. This is now being debated, and there will be a vote on it. If the government loses this vote... nobody knows what's supposed to happen. It would show that the current government does not have the support of the House of Commons, but what then? Do we have to have yet another election? Or does the Conservative Party hand over to the Labour Party to try to form a working coalition with some of the other parties? The second option would be a constitutional nightmare, because it would be in effect a regime change without an election, and that's never happened before in the UK. If we take the first option, there's a real risk that the result will be much the same as what we have now.<br><br>So yes, there is a constitution.

{"answer_id":"chatgpt-casual-3qgc27","question_id":"3qgc27","answer":"The French language has its unique ways of naming numbers between 70-99. The number 70 is called \"Soixante-dix\" because it means sixty-ten. Similarly, 80 in French is called \"Quatre-vingts\" as it translates to four twenties and 90 is called \"Quatre-Vingt-Dix\" meaning four twenties and ten. The reason behind this unique naming system is because the French language used to be based on a vigesimal (base-20) system. In this system, they counted up to 20 (vingt in French), and then used multiplication to get to higher numbers. Even though the decimal system is now used in French, the naming system for numbers 70-99 has stuck around and remains an interesting historical aspect of the language.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":1}

My tone (and I've noticed  &  discussed this with some other gay guys) actually differs depending on whom I'm talking to.

Of course though, there are gay men who have masculine voices and are even submissive in bed, but I have not met many. Typically, the more submissive you can get even a dominant gay guy, the more likely he is to use a more feminine, gentler, or higher tone.

The Social Security tax rate is set at 12.4%, but revenue from this tax is not enough to cover the cost of benefits. The money collected from the Social Security tax is used to pay current beneficiaries, with any excess funds invested in government bonds.

I would urge you to read\/watch it if you ever find time. It should be taken with a grain of salt, but it does posit a number of very good theories.<br><br>Essentially what it boils down to (at least in that particular author's opinion), is food supply. The agricultural revolution in Europe led to more efficient farming methods that required less work for more food. Less work equals more time, more time leads to boredom, boredom leads to curiosity, et cetera. So while everyone else around the world was spending all their daylight hours farming, Europe was spending a few daylight hours farming and the rest tinkering with stuff. This, theoretically, jump-started the scientific progress of the Europeans, and led to their eventual domination of the globe.<br><br>To play Devil's advocate, however, there were a number of other highly successful and powerful empires and civilizations throughout history, some of which we know quite a bit about (the Egyptians, the Chinese, the Sumerians), and some of which we don't (the Native Americans and the Zimbabweans, for instance). Many of these empires developed, for their time, very advanced technology, but all of these empires inevitably collapsed and much of that technology was then lost. Only very recently (as far as human history is concerned) has Europe held such dominance in technology. It should also be noted that Europe rose to power in the form of Rome and Macedonia, but also collapsed into the Dark Ages before re-rising to power in the modern context. A great deal of Europe's post-Dark Ages society is based on science and math kept alive by the Arabs (algebra and trigonometry, among others), and wouldn't have been possible without the Crusades bringing a lot of that information back.<br><br>So I guess the simplest explanation is probably pure luck. Of all the incredibly powerful civilizations that rose up and fell throughout history, Europe managed to do so right on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution and rise of globalization, ensuring their global dominance in the modern age. One might argue, however, that the balance of technological power is slowly shifting back towards the east, as China and India are definitely making up for lost time in the technological race against America and Europe.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":82.0,"pos":2}

In some cases, they decide to keep all the money they made, rather than sharing it with their shareholders as dividends. They might use that money to research new products or invest in new factories. When investors think that the company will use this money wisely in the future, they think the company's value will grow bigger over time. And when investors believe a company's value would grow bigger, they are happy to buy its stocks, even if it doesn't pay dividends. This is why sometimes companies without dividends can still have stocks that gain value.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":2}

All matter is composed of atoms, which are the building blocks of everything around us. Atoms are held together by strong forces that resist being broken apart, making it impossible to break them down beyond a certain point. Additionally, atoms themselves are composed of subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, which also have structure and cannot be ground down indefinitely. Therefore, grinding down to the molecular level is simply not possible due to the fundamental nature of matter.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":2}

When a wave reaches shallow water, the friction between the wave and the ocean floor causes the bottom part of the wave to slow down. This causes the wave to collapse and break. The angle of the wave determines which direction it will break. If the wave is approaching the shore at an angle from the left, it will break from left to right. If it is approaching from the right, it will break from right to left. Waves breaking all at once is rare because the size and speed of the wave are not uniform throughout its length.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":2}

Generally, the drink should be one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk, and one-third milk froth. However, since the milk is steamed and aerated, it increases in volume, so baristas make a smaller amount of actual espresso in order to fill the cup. If the cup is filled with a higher amount of coffee than that, then it is either a misinterpretation of your order or the barista's mistake.

{"answer_id":"c9setjy","question_id":"1dool1","answer":"I think your question may be confusing an instrument's own tuning arrangement with the idea of many instruments being in tune with each other.<br><br>**INTERNAL TUNING ON AN INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT:**<br><br>'Tuned in fourths', or fifths, probably refers in this question to the tuning arrangement of bowed string instruments commonly found in a symphony orchestra - the violin, viola, cello and double bass.<br><br>The four strings on a violin, viola or cello are each tuned a fifth apart. A 'fifth' is a musical interval. A musical interval is the difference between two different pitches, i.e. how much higher or lower one is from the other. The strings are tuned a fifth apart to allow a wide range of possible notes. This arrangement is traditional; other tuning setups are of course possible.<br><br>The double bass is tuned with each string being a fourth apart from its neighbouring strings. This is because it is a physically larger instrument than the others. Different notes are produced on each string by pressing on it, reducing the length of the bit of the string that is vibrating (and therefore producing sound) and as a result making the sound higher.<br><br>By pressing on the string you can only shorten its vibrating length and thus only make the sound higher. If two strings are a fifth apart, then responsibility for all the notes in between falls to the lower string.<br><br>On a double bass, the places on the string that you must press to produce the different notes are far apart because of the size of the instrument. Therefore it is physically more convenient in terms of handspan, reach, speed, etc. to have the strings spaced more closely. <br><br>That is why the double bass is tuned in fourths when the violin, viola and cello are tuned in fifths.<br><br>**TUNING ACROSS AN ORCHESTRA:**<br><br>An orchestra is not tuned in fifths - this is a mix up of terminology.<br><br>An orchestra is tuned to one reference pitch, which is typically a 'concert A', which is the name given to a pitch of 440 Hz (or sometimes 442\/443 Hz in other countries).<br><br>When each instrument plays their version of 'A', they must all sound the same \/ match up, otherwise the orchestra will sound out of tune. <br><br>When you hear an orchestra tuning up, each player is making small adjustments to their instrument to make their 'A' sound like the standard 'A', which is traditionally given by an oboe as that instrument is loud and difficult to adjust.<br><br>Each instrument with multiple places to produce sound (e.g. four strings on a violin) will use one string to get the standard 'A', and then will tune the other strings in relation to the 'A' string. As you can imagine it takes a lot of effort to tune a piano, with 88 different places to produce sound, as opposed to a trumpet, with one.<br><br>I hope this post explains the difference between tuning an instrument with itself (internal), and tuning an instrument in relation to another instrument (external), along with the other issues of understanding implied in the wording of the question.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":7.0,"pos":2}

It isn't enough that the CIA wanted JFK dead in the 60's, and in 2001 a totally different and completely separate entity wanted us to go to war to gather wealth, these actions need to be the will of an overarching and all powerful entity that only the truly smart and truly enlightened know about.  <br><br>Generally the breakdown is the Illuminati sort of theorist believes that there is a ruthless entity that is trying to guide humanity to some utopian or dystopian society no matter the costs, and the \"Lizard People\" theorist expands this conclusion to some other species that has malevolent intentions for humanity and the Earth.  These camps will try to show why faking the moon landing is beneficial to the REAL world government, or why taking out JFK was what will steer us to a dystopia or an alien invasion.  <br>This is not to say that I don't believe that governments and powerful people don't do shady shit.  Of course they do.  But these sort of conspiracy theorists try to tie all the shady shit together as one narrative instead of just realizing that throughout history there have been thousands of totally independent power-brokers all trying to accomplish their own limited goals.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":3.0,"pos":2}

I used to hang out at a club in Chicago called the Exit, and I was approached by the owner to go on the show, because it turned out that he was on the show's payroll to provide guests as needed, since the club was pretty much a magnet for the types of people (bikers, punk rockers, etc.) who one would normally encounter on the show. As it was explained to me, the people who go on these shows are real, as are their situations. The contract they sign says that if anyone \"chickens out\" the show can hire actors to play the part, since it would cost a lot of money to re-schedule shooting, or find last-minute guests to replace the scheduled ones. The segment I was recruited for featured a woman who was leaving her biker boyfriend to shack up with a Japanese sushi chef. Both the biker and the chef backed out, and I was hired to play the biker. We were both given the basic details of the story and were asked to improvise around that, without making up anything outlandish. We spent seven or eight hours in a small room backstage with several other guests, some real and some actors. We had to sign a rediculous contract that said they would sue the crap out of us if we told anyone that we were \"acting\" and lots of other horribly threatening legal language. I do remember that the contract stated that the production company owned our voices and likenesses \"forever, throughout the universe\" (seriously...I'm not kidding!) but we all agreed later that we thought it was funny. Anyway, they treated everyone great (they took me and a friend in a limo from the suburbs into Chicago, put us in an executive suite downtown and even gave us each $100 and admission to the House of Blues the evening before the show.

{"answer_id":"cfn77cb","question_id":"1yrsyf","answer":"To expand on what the robbob009 has said, men tend to be stronger because it's a more efficient allocation of resources and because it offsets sunk costs. There is something of a problem in evolution called \"the cost of males.\" This refers to the fact that in most species, most males have few or no offspring and others have many (high variance), while almost every female has as many offspring as she feasibly can (low variance).  If fewer men can get the job done, why do equal numbers of males and females persist? One answer is diversity: sexual reproduction offers increased genetic recombination, which is adaptive. Additionally, in social animals such as primates, one could argue that the increased size and strength of males confers benefits that enhance the fitness of their social group (group or kin selection). Edit: also worth adding to this list is that women engaging in strenuous physical activity while pregnant can put the baby in jeopardy, whereas the commitment of males to reproduction in many cases ends at conception.<br><br>It's important to note that when answering evolutionary questions, legacy is a huge factor. In many species of animals, females are larger and stronger.

For big money transfers, a player will be scouted multiple times and their agent will be quietly sounded out to see if their client would be up for a move. If Team A feel that they want to make an approach they will speak to Team B and usually make an offer. This may be negotiated and the process may be extremely fast or extremely protracted. Once the terms of the transfer have been agreed, Team B will give Team A permission to talk to their player to discuss contract terms. Up to this point, if Team A spoke to the player directly, this would be illegal under the rules of the game and is most often called \"tapping up\".<br>Once the terms of the transfer and personal terms have been agreed, the player will then move clubs during a designated transfer window, usually the summer or New Year period. Paperwork is filed with the respective FA and the player becomes the property of Team B.<br>Where this doesn't work is when a player is out of contract, should this happen, they are free to talk to any club and can move for free, also known as a Bosman transfer. Players in the last six months of their contract can talk to clubs from abroad. Youth team players who move between clubs are usually subject to a tribunal who will set the amount of compensation  Team B will pay to Team A, extra consideration is given to the time and financial expenditure Team A put in to training the youth player.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":2}

You can make the force of gravity from one object on another as large as you want by bringing it really close, so there is always a point that has the right balance of forces.  (It might be inside one of the objects, though).<br><br>But gravity gets stronger the closer two masses get.  So what happens if our suspended object is nudged just a little bit closer to one of the masses? The gravity from that mass gets stronger, and the gravity from the other mass gets weaker.  The object will get pulled towards the nearer mass, which will make the gravity from it stronger, which will pull the object closer...etc.  And it takes only a small nudge for this to happen.<br><br>This is called an *unstable equilibrium*: a small disturbance will knock it out of balance.  Imagine putting a ball on the top of a very steep hill; as long as the ball stays at the very top, it will be in balance, but if it moves slightly, it will start rolling down.<br><br>The other kind of equilibrium is a *stable equilibrium*: a small disturbance will move it, but it will naturally return to the equilibrium point.

When pressure increases, it becomes more difficult for the substance to change its state.

{"answer_id":"ccejnfu","question_id":"1n1b73","answer":"This is a complex question.  Humans can get 3 major problems when diving.  1) the bends (nitrogen bubbles forming when you come up), 2) nitrogen narcosis (too high nitrogen levels in the blood), 3)  barotrauma (rupture of air filled spaces like your sinus or lungs when you come up as gases expand).<br>The air we breathe is mostly nitrogen (78%) but our body doesn\u2019t use it (unlike oxygen which cells can use in metabolism).  That\u2019s why most of the problems relate to nitrogen as opposed to oxygen or carbon dioxide.<br>When you go down to depth,  air is compressed by the pressure.   In other words, the molecules of air (mostly nitrogen) are packed tighter together.  So more of them will fit in your lungs and sinus.  When you come up, they expand and cause barotrauma.  Similarly, more molecules will dissolve in your blood, at depth, high nitrogen levels make you feel drunk (nitrogen narcosis) and when you come up, they come out of the blood in bubbles (the bends) which damages nerves.  <br>Sea creatures like seals and whales are mammals that can descend quickly and come up and breathe the air just as we do.  However they have adaptive mechanisms to compensate for the change.  Their lungs compresses (and most of the oxygen is stored in the blood instead of the lungs so they can stay down longer).  That way, their lungs cannot explode when they come up (e.g. there\u2019s no air in them to expand).   It also eliminates the store of extra nitrogen (which humans have in the scuba tank) that could potentially be absorbed in the blood to cause nitrogen narcosis.<br> The ones that have sinuses have large Eustachian tubes that keep the sinus the same pressure as the outside world (we have this too, but they get easily blocked like when you come down in a plane).    Fish, don\u2019t have lungs or sinuses (generally) or they have other adaptive mechanisms (like a bed of blood vessels that engorges at depth to fill an air filled space).  <br>The general answer would be, that they have a series of adaptive mechanisms that prevent barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis and the bends.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":3}

{"answer_id":"ch1o77o","question_id":"23xtul","answer":"Well, let me try to help. I'm not a psychologist, psychiatrist or health professional of aky kind, but I have experienced different levels of depression through the last few years, and maybe that qualifies me to provide you some input.<br><br>The main issue when trying to explain depression is simply the fact that the word \"depression\" is widely missused to identify \"sadness\". People say \"I'm depressed\" when, in fact, what they are experiencing is a normal reaction to a bad situation, such as the loss of a loved one or the end of a relationship.<br><br>Depression is NOT sadness. Far from it. Actually, if you are sad, and can pinpoint the cause of your sadness, you are not likely to be depressed. In my experience, the word that most accurately describes depression is \"numbness\".<br><br>You know when you spend too much time lying on your arm, or too long sitting with your elbows against your knees, and you arm\/leg \"falls asleep\"? That's depression, but instead of not feeling anything in your arms or legs, you don't feel any propper emotion. That's why sometimes people DO get depressed after a specially traumatic event, just like your limbs get numb after too much pressure on a certain point. The parts of you that are responsible for feeling certain things simply fail to do so. They \"fall asleep\".<br><br>Depressed people are usually seen as \"sad\" by others for the simple fact that they are not feeling anything and, therefore, show no signs of stimulation. You tell them something that should be really heartbreaking and they reply with a simple \"yeah, I know, that sucks\", because for them no emotional response was triggered by the information you just provided. It's just like poking a numb limb with a toothpick, and assuming that it is dead because it didnt jerk or twitch or cause that person to say \"ouch\". It is not dead, its just not feeling that poke.<br><br>That is tremendously hard to explain to other people for another very simple reason: your subjective experience of life cannot be shared with others. There is no way to do it, no way you can explain someone how the color red looks to you without resorting to some sort of comparisson (\"red is the color of tomatoes and Super Mario's hat!\"), which is a technique that doesnt really work since there is no way to tell if the other person sees tomatoes and Super Mario the same way that you do. Maybe the way I see the color of a tomato is, for you, what you would call green. There is no way to know.<br><br>So when your spouse sees your actions and perceives them as a sign of you being sad, he is naturally going to assume that it should be easy to fix by simply doing something fun and chasing the sadness away. He is failing to realize that you cannot experience the sensation of \"something fun\", because the parts of you that are responsible for feeling that are \"asleep\". And when you tell him \"this is not sadness, it is depression!\", what he hears is \"this is not sadness, it is sadness!\", since the word is so widely missused. And then he does something that should make you feel better if you were just sad, but you don't, and he assumes that you simply refuse to feel better, because he can't experience what you are experiencing.<br><br>Try and get your spouse to do some reading about depression, and ask him to give you some credit and believe that what you feel is different than what he feels. If he is a reasonable guy, he'll get it eventually.<br><br>Finally, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Its a terrible thing, and it kind of feeds itself be keeping you away from the world. The more depressed you are, the less appealing the world seems to you and you end up doing less and less things, which gets you deeper and deeper into depression. But there is one thing your spouse is right about: you do have to do something about it. It feels wrong, it feels like nothing is going to help because you never feel anything anyway, but you need to look for help, maybe get a therapist, maybe get medicated. <br><br>Think of it like getting up in the morning to go out for a jog - it feels terrible to do it, and once you do get to it you dont feel any thinner. But if you keep at it, keep doing it even though you are tired or sleepy or lazy, you WILL get thinner, you WILL feel less and less lazy, and it WILL be better for you.<br><br>TL;DR: Depression is a numbness of the mind, and you cant explain that to people because nobody REALLY understands how another person feels, subjectivelly. Depression is not sadness, it is failure to properly perceive stimulation.<br><br>(BTW, English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammar mistakes)","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":226.0,"pos":3}

Firstly, advances in fishing technology and increased aquaculture production have led to a larger supply of fish in the market, keeping prices relatively stable. Additionally, subsidies and government support for the fishing industry may also keep prices low. Finally, consumer demand for seafood may not be sensitive to changes in supply, meaning that even with declining fish stocks, consumers may still be willing to pay the same price for fish. However, it is important to note that some types of fish, such as certain tuna species, have seen significant price increases due to their scarcity.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":3}

This happens because updates usually bring changes to the software's user interface and functionality. These changes can be confusing for users who were already familiar with the older version. Additionally, updates may also bring new features that some users may not find useful, and some of the old working features may get discontinued. Therefore it is important for users to have an understanding of what features they are losing and why they are losing them.

Potatoes, corn (maize), or wheat bread you could probably live off of. You wouldn't be healthy, not at all, but I don't think you'd die. If it was something much less nutritious like candy, you'd make it probably a couple months at max. <br><br>Also though, it's important to remember that even if you have a pretty balanced diet, you're going to die at some point. So you might be able to live years on an all-potato diet, but it would be doing some damage to you, cutting years off your lifespan, and it would make you much more likely to develop a lot of diseases due to nutritional deficit. And you would never \"starve\" to death by eating just one food, even if it was something really unhealthful like candy. It's important to recognize the difference between starvation and malnutrition. Far more people die from malnutrition than actual starvation. Malnutrition weakens the body, makes you vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, and will gradually kill you from nutritional deficit. Starvation is when you literally eat nothing for weeks and you die straight out from lack of energy to keep your body running. Most people die of malnutrition because they're not eating enough to get enough of their vital nutrients, which causes disease, not because they literally have no more energy to keep their body running (though that does happen too).","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":11.0,"pos":3}

However, there are ways to measure their eyesight. Pediatricians and optometrists use specialized tools and techniques to assess various aspects of a baby's visual development, such as how well they can see objects at different distances, how well their eyes work together, and how they react to light. These tests are non-invasive and painless. If a problem is detected, early interventions such as corrective glasses or eye exercises can be prescribed, which can improve a child's visual development in the long run.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":3}

They then dumped truckloads of rock and dirt into the river blocking it and creating a small temporary dam. The water level behind this dam rose until it came up to the tunnels which were built and diverted the water away from the construction site. This allowed the construction workers to work on the dam on the dry river floor. The dam includes valves which allows the river to flow under the dam if needed. The diversion tunnels also have valves which allows them to be sealed. When the dam construction were done the valves were closed off and the water level were allowed to rise to the top of the dam.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":3.0,"pos":3}

{"answer_id":"dw976db","question_id":"86zk6u","answer":"While \/u\/ebodak is not wrong to say that English is influenced by many different languages, that's actually not the reason -- and neither is it particularly unusual for a European language. \/u\/RogerBauman does suggest this, and while he correctly states that the pronunciation of \"wand\" comes from Norse, he's wrong to imply that the spelling does. The Old Norse word was \"v\u01ebndr\"; in English, the *spelling* was changed, not the pronunciation.<br><br>There are a lot of things going on here, and the history of language evolution is way too complicated to describe in any detail. But the most basic reason is that until printing became widespread, spelling rules weren't precisely fixed. People spoke a variety of different dialects, and spelled more or less as they pronounced.<br><br>Printing had the effect of harmonizing spelling rules, because multiple copies of a book could be made and sent to different parts of the country. That helped to create a standard version of the English language, but which dialect forms were to be the \"correct\" ones?<br><br>And so English isn't so much cobbled together from different *languages* -- at least, not to the extent you were probably led to believe -- but from different versions *of itself*. So the same word might have been pronounced in very different ways in different parts of the country, and although there was a preference for spelling them according to London pronunciation, this wasn't consistently applied.<br><br>However, once English spelling rules had become fixed, they *stayed* fixed. But then, almost immediately, English went through a series of very profound sound changes -- one of the most important is called the \"Great Vowel Shift\", and \"Great\" is not an exaggeration: it really scrambled all the long vowels (the effect was felt less in northern parts of England, which is why British accents can be sharply divided between \"northern\" and \"southern\").<br><br>Some other languages (for example, German) have occasional spelling reforms so the spellings (almost) keep pace with the pronunciations. In other cases (for example, Italian), the standard dialect is a very recent invention (standard Italian was basically created in the first half of the 19th century, and when Italy was unified in 1861, only 2.5% of the population could speak it), so the pronunciation hasn't had time to deviate from the spelling.<br><br>Any word that was already part of the English language before about 1500 is spelled more-or-less as it was pronounced *somewhere* at the time. Any word that was imported after (usually from Latin or Greek) had its pronunciation mangled to fit the spelling and English pronunciation rules as best as possible: the \"x\" in \"xenophobia\" is pronounced like a \"z\" because it is impossible in English to pronounce \"x\" at the beginning of a word, while the \"ph\" represents a sound in Ancient Greek that doesn't exactly exist in English, but in modern Greek is pronounced like an \"f\".<br><br>So it's a really complicated story involving ever-changing dialects, the evolution of the language, questionable decisions being made by highly-educated people who had more influence than they really deserved, and so on. In some cases they inserted letters into words even though they weren't pronounced, simply because they decided it came from a Latin word that had that letter in it. For example, in the 14th century, the \"b\" was added to \"doubt\" even though it came from French \"douter\" by over-educated scribes, simply because it's etymologically related to \"dubious\".<br><br>And occasionally, there are mysteries. Nobody is entirely certain why we have a \"u\" in \"build\", but it may be because it's an attempt to reflect different pronounciations in different Middle English dialects: \"bild\" and \"buld\". But that's just a guess.<br><br>If you think this is a long explanation, it barely scratches the surface.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":3}

They've been treated as second-class citizens and have experienced abuses from structures of power, including indiscriminate killing of those following the Jewish faith, most famously under the regime of Adolf Hitler, whose extermination of Jews is commonly referred to as the Holocaust. A big factor in this situation is the lack of a central homeland of the Jewish people. They tried, rather unsuccessfully, to integrate themselves into whatever culture they found themselves in until they were rooted out or hunted down. <br><br>This unstable situation gave rise to Zionism, the movement for Jews to establish their own state (country, nation, whatever word you prefer), preferably in Israel, the biblical promised land, also called Palestine.<br><br>The Zionist movement was kickstarted and championed by a man named Theodor Herzl. He petitioned different world powers for a grant of land for the Zionists to form a state and begin attracting Jews from around the world to make up the population. This was tricky, as the world powers were only willing to give up fairly crappy bits of land (Britain was ready to give the Zionists Uganda), and the Zionists at large were dead set on forming their state in Palestine.<br><br>A breakthrough came with the Balfour Declaration, a position on behalf of the Crown pledging its support for the Zionists' place in Palestine. The declaration was later adopted by the League of Nations. <br><br>Jews began purchasing land in Palestine and working it to sustain themselves and form communities. This pissed off the local Arabs, sparking tensions that are still very present today. Over time, more and more Jews went to Israel.

Let us assume a straight walled circular pond, with a drain at the center bottom. As the water begins to drain, the flow of water comes from the edges towards the center. This creates momentum at an angle from the direction the water is actually being allowed to move - straight down.

It's very cheap and simple to add to the water supply, and it's harmless in reasonable quantities. Fluoride is also present in toothpastes and mouthwashes for this reason. So governments around the world decided to add it to the public water supply, protecting every person's teeth and reducing pain, medical costs, disease, etc for little cost and effort. It also strengthens bones generally and protects against things like osteoporosis, although the doses in public water supplies are so low that this isn't a very pronounced effect -- usually your doctor would give you much higher doses if you needed that protection. <br><br>Fluoride at high doses can be dangerous. Fatal dosages for adults begin at around 5 grams, which is equivalent to about 5,000 litres\/1,320 gallons of normally fluoridated water in one day (note the 'begins' -- if you are an 80kg\/180lb man it would be about double this).

In traditional reactors there are two basic processes:<br>1) An \"enriched uranium\" cycle. Here we make fuel by \"enriching\" uranium (keeping fissile U-235 and discarding useless U-238), and we fission it with low energy (called \"thermal\") neutrons. <br>2) A \"Fast Breeder\" cycle. Here we make fuel by turning U-238 into Plutonium, and then we fission the plutonium. To make the U-238 absorb neutrons, we need to use high energy (\"fast\") neutrons. <br><br>Both approaches are unfortunate because they make it really easy to make nuclear bombs. An enriched uranium cycle can only use ~0.7% of the uranium, which isn't good. Fast breeder cycles have to form plutonium, and so form a lot of long half life nuclear waste (search for TRU or actinides). This is bad because then we have to store it somewhere. Using fast neutrons also means that the structure ends up more radioactive, which makes it harder to decommission a site. Fast reactors also tend to be more unstable, in that there's less stuff slowing the neutrons down and moderating the power output.<br><br>If we use thorium, then instead what we do is turn thorium into uranium-233 by getting it to absorb a neutron, and then we fission the uranium 233. What's really nice about this process is that we can turn thorium into uranium using thermal neutrons. So we don't have to use high energy neutrons. Because we fission uranium getting TRU waste requires that an atom *fails* to fission both as Uranium-233 and Plutonium-239; this is rare and so we don't form much long life waste. Since the overall process requires 2 neutrons, and the fission of U-233 emits about 2.2 on average, this cycle also emits far less neutron radiation.<br><br>The really nice thing is that thorium naturally comes in only 1 flavour, which is the one we need. So we can use all of the thorium (which is itself around 3-4x more common than uranium), instead of only a tiny fraction, or needing to use a fast breeder. There's no excuse to be handling plutonium or running enrichment facilities, so it's harder to build a bomb. It's not impossible, but due to the way the process works the Uranium-233 tends to get contaminated with uranium-232. In the reactor this doesn't matter at all, but for bombs it's a really big problem.<br><br><br>Now, all of this applies just as well to taking a \"traditional\" reactor and running it with thorium in it. Often when you hear about \"thorium reactors\", what people mean is a \"molten salt reactor\" using a thorium fuel. In this case there's quite a bit more going on.<br><br>In a molten salt reactor, we replace the standard fuel rods with a fluid; normally a mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. Then we dissolve the fuels (thorium and uranium-233) in this fluid, normally as their tetrafluoride salts. The basic reason to do this is that fluoride salts are chemically unreactive (unlike metals), and have have very high boiling points. So there's never any pressure inside the reactor, which means that we don't need to have large pressure vessels. This means the reactors are much smaller and easier to shield or bury. It also means we can go to higher temperatures than are feasible with a steam cycle, which means better efficiency and new possible uses (like making hydrogen).<br><br>Where it's really awesome is the safety side. When the fuel is a fluid, it can be removed from the reactor really quickly to a safe holding pan if anything wierd happens, or if the temperature in the reactor goes too high. An accident like Fukushima is thus much much harder to imagine, because if the temperature goes too high the fuel is moved from the reactor (where it's encouraged to fission) to somewhere where it's not. Furthermore, fluids expand when they warm up. So if the reactor warms up a little, the fuel expands and so there will be fewer fissile atoms in the reactor, which tends to reduce power output. As a result, these reactors are intrinsically stable when the power output changes, or if there are bubbles in the fuel (whereas, say, Chernobyl was not; if the cooling water started to boil it *increased* its power output... which is what caused the accident).<br><br>It also turns out that with a fluoride fuelled reactor, it's not too hard to remove the fuel from the lithium-beryllium-fluoride fluid, and then separate the fission products and other short lived waste from the reactor. What this means is that instead of forming lots of long lived waste by \"cooking\" short lived waste in neutrons for a couple of years, we get it out. Some of it is medically very valuable, which is a bonus. For everyone else, the point is that we end up with \"waste\" that's less radioactive than uranium ore after 200-300 years. Whilst that's still quite a while, we understand how to build a structure that lasts that long, and how to mark it so that people will know what it is in 300 years. It also turns out that the quantities of waste involved are tiny. For the UK, if we got all of our energy (electrical, petrol, the lot) from thorium we'd need a couple of swimming-pool sized containers to store a few centuries worth of waste.<br><br><br>Overall, these thorium MSR's or LFTR's are really quite cool, and at least a couple of countries are interested in them. India has had a thorium program for a while, because they have quite a lot of thorium; the US used to have one at Oak Ridge, and both China and Japan seem to be getting programs started.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":10.0,"pos":3}

Firstly, the effectiveness of tranquilizers can be unpredictable, and the dosage needed to subdue someone can vary depending on their weight, health condition, and other factors. This makes it difficult for police officers to administer the right amount of tranquilizer quickly and accurately during high-pressure situations. Additionally, tranquilizers take time to take effect, which means that an individual may still pose a threat to the officers or others while waiting for them to become incapacitated. Lastly, tranquilizers can have severe side effects or even prove fatal if used in the wrong dosages or in combination with other medications. For these reasons, police officers often have to rely on deadly force as the safest and most effective way to eliminate a threat.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":3}

Sharing a meal with others, trying new cuisines, and enjoying comfort foods can bring people together and create happy memories. Ultimately, our enjoyment of eating is complex and multifaceted, incorporating both physiological and social factors.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":3}
{"answer_id":"c59p67g","question_id":"w2nop","answer":"Fantasy Football Scoring varies from league to league, but the basic scoring\/rules will give you an outline of how most leagues work.<br><br>Basically at the draft the each team picks players they like.  They usually cover the offensive positions :quarterback, running back, wide receiver,  tight end, kicker, some leagues also do defensive players.<br><br>Each week you pick you make a \"starting lineup\" of your drafted players based on who you think is going to perform well.<br><br>Scoring is then based on the stats of the players for the week.  <br><br>Usually, points are awarded for two things.  Yards and touchdowns.   if one of the players you started get a touch down you get points. (Usually 4 or 6 based on your league rules.)<br><br>Points are also awarded for yardage gained.  In most basic leagues 10 yards equals 1 point.  therefore, if your running back rushes for 80 yards that is eight points.    But these vary for league to league.  A lot of leagues give quarterbacks 1 point for every 25 yards because they accrue more yards than other positions.<br><br>Defensive scoring is based on defensive stats sacks, interceptions, etc..)  The value of each, again depends on the settings of your league.<br><br>Kickers also get points.  a point after touchdown =points, field goal= points.<br><br>There is some variation too, based on how the league is set up. Some leagues do a point per reception (catch) and other things as well.<br><br>Some leagues go \"head to head\"  meaning my fantasy team is going up against another fantasy team from the league.  Whoever gets more points that week gets the win and standings are based on win-loss records, lust like IRL. The best records then go on to a fantasy playoffs culminating in a fantasy Superbowl.   This is all usually done with a monetary prize at the end.<br> <br> That's why the guys on The League not only want to win, but also  for their opponents to lose and lose miserably.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":3.0,"pos":3}
{"answer_id":"chatgpt-formal-7xx9l7","question_id":"7xx9l7","answer":"Terraforming the Moon and colonizing it is a concept that has been discussed extensively in recent times. Although technically possible, it is a daunting task that involves significant financial and technical challenges. One of the major disadvantages of the Moon is its lack of atmosphere, which makes it impossible for humans to survive without protective gear. Creating an atmosphere on the Moon would require significant resources and technology beyond our present capabilities. Additionally, the Moon's low gravity would make it challenging to maintain a stable atmosphere. Given the obstacles, it may be possible to establish small, self-sustaining lunar colonies in the future, but terraforming the Moon remains unlikely for the foreseeable future.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":3}

{"answer_id":"chatgpt-casual-2tc872","question_id":"2tc872","answer":"Even if the e-cigarette liquid doesn't contain formaldehyde, it can still be present in the vapor. This is because the heating element of an e-cigarette can cause a chemical reaction that converts some of the other chemicals in the liquid into formaldehyde. This is especially true at higher temperatures or with prolonged use. Additionally, many e-cigarettes have been found to have poor quality control and may contain impurities or contaminants that can also contribute to the formation of formaldehyde in the vapor. It's important to remember that e-cigarettes are not completely harmless and that more research is needed to fully understand their potential health effects.","answer_label":"generated_answer_casual","answer_score":null,"pos":3}

{"answer_id":"dwfh25l","question_id":"87rwek","answer":"Ctrl+Z is commonly implemented through a \"command pattern\".<br><br>When you bold text, move a box, or whatever in your program, a \"command\" is created.  The command is an object that contains the data of the change (e.g. box id, 'new location') and two actions:<br>- do<br>- undo<br><br>If you tell the command to \"do\" it's action then it performs the action.  The \"undo\" action performs the logically opposite function.<br><br>Each action's do  &  undo code is specific to the command.  For example, a \"move box\" command has the logic to move the box.  The \"bold\" command has logic to bold text.  From a command perspective we don't really care how it is done, just that you can \"do\" and \"undo\" an action.<br><br>These commands are held in a \"command buffer\".  When you press Ctrl+Z the undo action of the last command is called.  The prior command becomes the last command and it can be undone.  This can be repeated until there are no more commands to undo.<br><br>You can also \"redo\" a command (Ctrl+Y) which calls \"do\" on the last undone command.  Like the undo chain, there is a redo chain to the next command that was undone. [The command buffer is a \"doubly linked list\"].","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":4.0,"pos":3}
{"answer_id":"cbeo0j6","question_id":"1jha1o","answer":"The plane you show might be doing some of many things. Firstly, it might actually be falling. But it is moving quite fast, so that falling might not be obvious immediately. It might be doing a tight turn, pulling 4+ Gs, and the small amount that the plane's wings are off the vertical is enough to balance gravity. Lastly, the a plane can get lift from the body structure, the 'vertical' (now horizontal) rudder, and from the propeller, if the plane is pointing slightly upward. Most likely, it is doing a bit of all three, allowing it to fly with the wings pointing toward the ground.","answer_label":"dataset_answer_random","answer_score":2.0,"pos":3}
{"answer_id":"chatgpt-formal-5j30ge","question_id":"5j30ge","answer":"Pus is a thick, whitish-yellow fluid that appears in infected wounds due to the accumulation of dead white blood cells, dead bacteria, and damaged tissue. It is a normal response of the body to fight off bacterial infections and initiate the healing process. White blood cells called neutrophils and macrophages migrate to the site of injury or infection to engulf and eliminate bacteria, triggering the release of cytokines and other immune molecules that cause inflammation and fever. Pus-filled abscesses may need to be drained and treated with antibiotics to prevent the further spread of infection.","answer_label":"generated_answer_formal","answer_score":null,"pos":3}
{"answer_id":"dgxlkm8","question_id":"68cos9","answer":"Latent heat, loosely speaking, is the amount of heat lost (or absorbed) in a transition between states. This, logically, must depend on the nature of the transition. If you are changing from one state to something completely different, it must have a higher latent heat. <br><br>So sometimes, what pressure does is that it brings the two states very close to each other making the transition not that \"stark\". Eg. When you compress a gas, you make it more like a liquid. Or if you try to expand a liquid (which is difficult, since most liquids are practically unresponsive to density changes).","answer_label":"dataset_answer_top1","answer_score":2.0,"pos":3}
